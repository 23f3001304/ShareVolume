# SEC Common Stock Shares Outstanding Viewer

## Summary

This is a static web application designed to visualize data on the number of common stock shares outstanding for publicly traded companies. It fetches data directly from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) EDGAR API.

The application loads with default data for **Biogen (CIK: 0000875045)**, displaying the maximum and minimum number of outstanding shares reported for fiscal years after 2020. It can also dynamically fetch and display the same data for any other company by providing a 10-digit CIK number as a URL query parameter.

## Setup

This project is a static web application and requires no special installation or build process.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2.  **Run a local web server (Recommended):**
    While you can open `index.html` directly in a browser (`file:///...`), browser security policies (CORS) may block API requests to the SEC. It is recommended to serve the files from a local web server.

    If you have Python 3 installed:
    ```bash
    python -m http.server
    ```
    Then, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

## Usage

### Default View

Open `index.html` in your web browser. The page will display the maximum and minimum number of outstanding common stock shares for Biogen for fiscal years after 2020.

### Viewing Other Companies

To view data for a different company, append a `CIK` query parameter to the URL with the company's 10-digit CIK number. The page will dynamically fetch the new data and update the view without a full reload.

**Example:**
To view data for Walmart Inc. (CIK: 0001018724), use the following URL:
`index.html?CIK=0001018724`

## Code Explanation

### `data.json`

This file contains the pre-processed data for the default company, Biogen. It is generated by fetching data from the SEC API, filtering for entries after fiscal year 2020, and identifying the records with the highest and lowest `val` (number of shares). This serves as the initial state of the application and avoids an API call on the default page load.

The structure of the file is:
```json
{
  "entityName": "Biogen",
  "max": {
    "val": 149463945,
    "fy": "2021"
  },
  "min": {
    "val": 141974797,
    "fy": "2023"
  }
}
```

### `index.html`

This is the main file for the application. It contains the HTML structure, styling, and the client-side JavaScript logic.

*   **HTML Structure**: The body contains a simple layout with a main heading and cards to display the maximum and minimum share data. Key elements have specific IDs for easy manipulation by JavaScript:
    *   `share-entity-name`
    *   `share-max-value` / `share-max-fy`
    *   `share-min-value` / `share-min-fy`

*   **JavaScript Logic (`<script>` tag)**:
    1.  **`DOMContentLoaded` Listener**: The script waits for the page to fully load. It then checks the URL for a `?CIK=` query parameter.
    2.  **`getCIKFromURL()`**: A helper function to parse the `window.location.search` string and extract the CIK value.
    3.  **Conditional Loading**:
        *   If a CIK is found in the URL, it calls `fetchCompanyData(cik)` to retrieve live data from the SEC.
        *   If no CIK is found, it fetches the default data from the local `data.json` file.
    4.  **`fetchCompanyData(cik)`**:
        *   Constructs the appropriate SEC API endpoint URL for the given CIK.
        *   To avoid potential CORS issues when running locally, this function could be adapted to use a proxy, though direct fetching is attempted.
        *   Sets a descriptive `User-Agent` header as required by the SEC.
        *   On a successful fetch, it calls `processData()` to parse the response.
    5.  **`processData(apiData)`**:
        *   Takes the raw JSON response from the SEC API.
        *   Filters the `.units.shares` array to include only entries where the fiscal year (`fy`) is greater than 2020 and a numeric `val` exists.
        *   Iterates through the filtered results to find the objects with the maximum and minimum `val`.
        *   Returns a structured object `{ entityName, max, min }`.
    6.  **`updatePage(data)`**:
        *   Takes the processed data object.
        *   Updates the document's `<title>`.
        *   Updates the text content of all designated HTML elements (`#share-entity-name`, `#share-max-value`, etc.) with the new company's data.
